    <h2>Who Invented 3D Printing?</h2>
<p>The first 3D printer, which used the stereolithography technique, was created by Charles W. Hull
    <br> in the mid-1980s. Stereolithography has traditionally been an expensive commercial technique, 
     <br> with machines costing in the five and even six figures, but recent years have seen the advent of
      <br> desktop professional stereolithography printers costing a few thousand dollars, as well as
       <br> consumer systems that start well under a grand.

<p>
    In 1986, Hull founded 3D Systems, a company that today sells 3D printers that use a variety of
    <br> technologies. They range from entry-level kits to advanced commercial systems, and 3D Systems
     <br> also provides on-demand parts services, mostly to business users.

<h2>What Are the Benefits of 3D Printing?</h2>

<p>With 3D printing, designers have the ability to quickly turn concepts into 3D models
    <br> or prototypes (a.k.a. "rapid prototyping"), and implement rapid design changes. It lets
     <br> manufacturers produce products on demand rather than in large runs, improving inventory
      <br> management and reducing warehouse space. People in remote locations can fabricate objects
       <br> that would otherwise be inaccessible to them.</p>

<p>From a practical standpoint, 3D printing can save money and material versus subtractive
    <br> techniques, as very little raw material is wasted. And it promises to change the nature of
     <br> manufacturing, eventually letting consumers download files for printing even complex 3D
      <br> objects—including, for example, electronics devices—in their own homes.</p>

<h2>What Does the Future Hold for 3D Printing?</h2>

<p>A variety of 3D printers for homes and small businesses is readily available
    <br>but they are still often viewed as exotic, and rather pricey,contraptions. Expect
    <br> that to change within the next few years, when 3D printers will become more
     <br> commonplace in houses —to be found on workbenches, in studios, in home offices,
     <br> and even in the kitchen. You may not find them in every household, but they'll
     <br> become indispensable to those people who do have them. For the most part, items made 
     <br> with 3D printers have had homogenous interiors, but we'll start to see more complex
      <br> creations combining multiple materials and composites, as well as printable electronics.
       <br> With today's 3D printers, if you lose your TV remote's battery cover, it may be possible
        <br> to print a replacement cover. With tomorrow's, if you lose your remote, perhaps you'll
         <br> be able to print a whole new remote.
         <br>
         <br>
         Also, 3D printing is gaining a foothold in outer space. NASA is experimenting with 3D printers on
         <br> board the International Space Station. Eventually, 3D printers could be used to create habitats on
          <br> Mars and other worlds. To save the Apollo 13 astronauts from dying of carbon monoxide
           <br> asphyxiation, NASA had to in effect find a way to fit a square peg into a round hole. Had there
            <br> been a 3D printer on board, they may have been able to easily solve the problem by designing
             <br> and printing a connector.
             <br>
             
             <p>Medical applications of 3D printing don't stop with prosthetics, hearing aids, and dental crowns.
                 <br> The past few years, we have seen an explosion in the variety and uses of 3D printers. It's similar
                 <br> to where personal computing was circa 1980. Though it's easy enough to see some of the areas the field
                  <br> of 3D printing will branch into, others are beyond our ability to predict, just as no one around in 1980
                   <br> could have imagined much of what the personal computer would turn into. It's possible that 3D printing 
                   <br> may not have the same impact as the PC on a consumer, everyday-life level, but it does have the potential to
                    <br> revolutionize manufacturing and, perhaps more important, bring it into the hands of everyday consumers. One thing's
                     <br> for sure, though: 3D printing is here to stay.
