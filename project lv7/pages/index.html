       <h2>What Is 3D Printing?</h2>

       <p>
        At its most basic, 3D printing is a manufacturing process in which material is laid down, layer by
        <br> layer, to form a three-dimensional object. (This is deemed an additive process because the
         <br> object is built from scratch, as opposed to subtractive processes in which material is cut, drilled,
          <br> milled, or machined off.) Although 3D printers employ a variety of materials (such as plastic or
           <br> metal) and techniques (see "How Does 3D Printing Work?" below), they share the ability to turn 
           <br> digital files containing three-dimensional data—whether created on a computer-aided design (CAD) or computer-aided
            <br> manufacturing (CAM) program, or from a 3D scanner—into physical objects.

        How Does 3D Printing Work?
       </h2>

       <p>
        Much like traditional printers, 3D printers use a variety of technologies. The most commonly
        <br> known is fused deposition modeling (FDM), also known as fused filament fabrication (FFF). In it,
         <br> a filament—composed of acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), polylactic acid (PLA), or 
         <br> another thermoplastic—is melted and deposited through a heated extrusion nozzle in layers.
          <br> The first 3D printers to come to market, made in the mid 1990s by Stratasys with help from IBM,
           <br> used FDM (a term trademarked by Stratasys), as do most 3D printers geared to consumers,
            <br> hobbyists, and schools.
             <br>
             <br>
             Another technology used in 3D printing is stereolithography. In it, a UV laser is shined into a vat
             <br> of ultraviolet-sensitive photopolymer, tracing the object to be created on its surface. The 
              <br> polymer solidifies wherever the beam touches it, and the beam "prints" the object layer by layer
               <br> per the instructions in the CAD or CAM file it's working from.
                <br>
                <br>
               <br> In a variation on that, you also have digital light projector (DLP) 3D printing. This method
                <br> exposes a liquid polymer to light from a digital light processing projector. This hardens the
                 <br> polymer layer by layer until the object is built, and the remaining liquid polymer is drained off.
                 <br>
                 <br>
                 Multi-jet modeling is an inkjet-like 3D printing system that sprays a colored, glue-like binder
                 <br> onto successive layers of powder where the object is to be formed. This is among the fastest 
                  <br> methods, and one of the few that supports multicolor printing.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  It's possible to modify a standard inkjet to print with materials other than ink. Enterprising do-it-
                  <br> yourselfers have built or modded print heads, generally piezoelectric heads, to work with various 
                   <br> materials—in some cases printing out the print heads themselves on other 3D printers!
                    <br> Companies like MicroFab Technologies sell 3D-capable print heads (as well as complete printing
                     <br> systems).
